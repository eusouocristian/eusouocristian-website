# My personal website 
This repository is where I place all code related to my website http://eusouocristian.com. I have tried the experience of programming a website from scratch from Django framework. That was a great experience to have!

# Features
Once I was just practicing and braking the ice with this framework, there are some tools that from now may not make sense for a personal website.
That is the reason:
- **Gerenciador de tarefas** (task manager, from Portuguese): This feature exists in order to practice the service of saving data and getting it from a databank.
- **Users Sign Up / Sign In**: This tool was built for handling credentials in Django.
- **Deploy**: The project was deployed on Heroku and I registered the domain name to understand how this process is like.

# New features
I am planning to use this code as a template for building my website and share my projects.
